# Project: Create and Mint Token
In this project I create a smart contract project that uses require() to allow functionality only in specific instances.


## Description
In this project I complete the requirements for my ETH+AVAX Metacrafters course by creating a smart contract project that uses require() to limit functionality to specific, permitted individuals.

This program can be run using the website Remix linked here: https://remix.ethereum.org/


## How to run the program
